# Question 2 - Weather data analysis 
# This program analyses the temperature data stored in CSV files, 
# calculate the requested statistics, 
# and save the results to the specified text files.


# NOTE: Place the temperature_data folder in the working directory.
# NOTE: Install pandas if not already installed using pip install pandas.
